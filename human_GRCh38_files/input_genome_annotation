In order to generate the optimized genome annotation we need to provide the initial genome annotation as input to the "2_Optimized_annotation_assembler.R" code.
Popular unoptimized genome annotation for the GRCh38 human genome build is provided within the latest mouse reference transcriptome provided by 10x Genomics and
which is available from https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A.tar.gz. The genome annotation can be found in the "genes" subfolder under
the name "genes.gtf".
